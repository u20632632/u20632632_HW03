<h3>@ViewBag.Message</h3>

<p>I’m a people-person. I love meeting new people and learning about their lives and their backgrounds. I can almost always find common ground with strangers, and I like making people feel comfortable in my presence. I find this skill is especially helpful when kicking off projects with new people. I am passionate about my work. Because I love what I do, I have a steady source of motivation that drives me to do my best.</p>
